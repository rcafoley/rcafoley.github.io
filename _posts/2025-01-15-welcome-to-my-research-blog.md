# Welcome to My Research Blog

I'm excited to launch this blog as a platform to share insights from my research in neuromechanics and ergonomics. As a PhD candidate at Ontario Tech University, I've been deeply involved in understanding the complex relationships between biomechanics and workplace ergonomics.

## What You Can Expect

In this blog, I'll be sharing:

- **Research Updates**: Insights from my ongoing work in fatigue prediction and muscle physiology
- **Methodology Deep Dives**: Detailed explanations of the techniques and approaches I use in my research  
- **Industry Applications**: How academic research translates to real-world ergonomic solutions
- **Tool Development**: Updates on the open-source tools I'm developing for the research community

## My Current Research Focus

*Research in action: Exploring the intersection of biomechanics, ergonomics, and human performance*

My work centers on developing predictive models for neuromuscular fatigue, particularly in manufacturing settings. This involves:

- High-density EMG analysis using advanced signal processing techniques
- Motor unit decomposition and analysis
- Force-time history dependent fatigue modeling
- Real-world application in industrial ergonomics

## Recent Highlights

I recently published a comprehensive scoping review and meta-analysis of upper limb strength asymmetry in *Scientific Reports*, which provides new evidence for understanding handedness effects across populations. This work builds on years of research into motor neuron excitability and postural control.

## Looking Ahead

I'm particularly excited about the intersection of traditional biomechanical research and modern data science approaches. The tools I'm developing, like the MU Edit to OpenHDEMG converter, are designed to make advanced EMG analysis more accessible to researchers worldwide.
