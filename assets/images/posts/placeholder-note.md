# Placeholder Images Note

These are placeholder images for the blog post examples. When you have real images from your research, simply replace these files with your actual images using the same filenames.

You can add:
- Research diagrams
- Lab equipment photos
- Data visualization charts
- Conference presentation slides
- Experimental setup photos
- EMG signal traces
- Motor unit recordings
- Any other relevant research imagery

Just keep the same filenames or update the markdown files to reference your new image names.
